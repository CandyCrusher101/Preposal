# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I wanted to make a short and simple visual novel with a light hearted story, nothing too deep.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

No teammates :( I do think I will be asking for help from other people who will be using the same program as me

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I need help with understanding renpy. I did see some youtube tutorials of the basics, but knowing me I'm going to get stumped somewhere in the process of doing this on my own.
